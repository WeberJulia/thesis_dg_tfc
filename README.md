# Applications of the terrain-following coordinates to discontinuous Galerkin schemes

This repository stores the work on my master thesis. 

The folder "Thesis" stores my master thesis and the pictures, which are used.

The path "julia_code" stores the julia codes for both parts of the thesis. 
The first part deals with the topic how a discontinuous Galerkin scheme works. 
The second part stores a libary for the transformation of Cartesian coordinates to terrain-following coordinates. 
In addition it stores the application of the libary on a two-dimensional grid and a three-dimensional one.

The last folder stores the protocols of the regulary meetings for updates and questions of the working progress.
